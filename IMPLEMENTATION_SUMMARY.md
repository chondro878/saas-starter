# Fulfillment System - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`lib/db/schema.ts`)
- Added `orders` table with full support for:
  - Subscription cards
  - Bulk holiday pack cards  
  - Individual extra cards
- Tracks recipient and return addresses (snapshot at order creation)
- Order status workflow: pending ‚Üí printed ‚Üí mailed
- Foreign keys to recipients, occasions, users, and teams

### 2. Database Migration (`lib/db/migrations/0003_add_orders_table.sql`)
- SQL migration file ready to run
- Creates orders table with proper indexes
- Foreign key constraints
- Indexes for common queries (status, user_id, occasion_date)

### 3. Automated Order Creation (`app/api/cron/create-orders/route.ts`)
- Nightly cron job (runs at 2 AM)
- Creates orders 15 days before occasions
- Checks:
  - Active subscription
  - Card limits by plan (Essentials: 5, Stress Free: 12, Concierge: 25)
  - Default return address exists
  - No duplicate orders
- Logs all skipped orders with reasons

### 4. Fulfillment Dashboard (`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/fulfillment/page.tsx`)
- Admin-only view (only shows for role='owner')
- Shows all pending orders to print today
- Summary cards (total, subscription, bulk, individual)
- Bulk print all or individual order printing
- Shows printed-but-not-mailed orders separately

### 5. Print Components

#### Labels (`print-labels-button.tsx`)
- Generates Avery 5160 format PDFs (1" x 2.625")
- 2 labels per order (recipient + return address)
- 30 labels per page (3 columns √ó 10 rows)
- Auto-opens print dialog
- Marks orders as "printed" automatically

#### Reminder Cards (`print-cards-button.tsx`)
- Generates 3" x 5" reminder cards
- 2 cards per page
- Shows: recipient name, occasion type, date, notes
- Indicates card type (subscription/bulk/individual)
- Dotted cut lines between cards

#### Mark as Sent (`mark-sent-button.tsx`)
- Updates order status to "mailed"
- Records mail date
- Refreshes page automatically

### 6. Order History Page (`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/orders/page.tsx`)
- Customer-facing view of all their orders
- Stats: sent, in process, this year, total
- Card usage breakdown by type
- Full order list with status badges
- Filterable view by status

### 7. API Endpoints

Created these endpoints:
- `POST /api/orders/[id]/mark-printed` - Mark single order as printed
- `POST /api/orders/[id]/mark-sent` - Mark single order as sent
- `POST /api/orders/mark-all-printed` - Bulk mark as printed
- `GET /api/cron/create-orders` - Nightly automation

### 8. Navigation Updates (`app/(dashboard)/dashboard/layout.tsx`)
- Added "Fulfillment" link (admin-only, printer icon)
- Added "My Orders" link (all users, file icon)
- Role-based visibility

### 9. Vercel Cron Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Configured to run at 2 AM daily
- Schedule: `0 2 * * *`

### 10. Documentation
- `FULFILLMENT_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## üìã Next Steps (Required)

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
cd /Users/juliangarcia/Projects/saas-starter
npm run db:push
# OR
npx drizzle-kit push:pg
```

### 2. Add Environment Variable

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
```

Generate one with:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add fulfillment system with automated order creation"
git push
```

In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Add `CRON_SECRET` with same value as local `.env`
3. Redeploy

### 4. Test Locally

Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Test cron endpoint:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/cron/create-orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET"
```

Visit:
- http://localhost:3000/dashboard/fulfillment (admin view)
- http://localhost:3000/dashboard/orders (customer view)

## üéØ Your Daily Workflow

1. **Morning**: Open `/dashboard/fulfillment`
2. **Print**: Click "Print All Labels" + "Print All Cards"
3. **Stuff**: Insert greeting card + reminder card into envelopes
4. **Label**: Apply printed Avery labels
5. **Mail**: Take to post office
6. **Mark**: Click "Mark as Sent" for each order
7. **Done**: Orders move to "mailed" status

## üé® Card Types Supported

### Subscription Cards (Auto-Created)
- Created automatically by cron job
- Count toward yearly limit
- Based on user's plan

### Bulk Pack Cards (Manual or Purchase)
- 15 cards for $39
- Don't count toward subscription limit
- You'll need to create these manually or add purchase flow

### Individual Cards (Manual or Purchase)
- Extra cards at $9 each
- Don't count toward subscription limit
- You'll need to create these manually or add purchase flow

## üìä Subscription Limits

| Plan | Cards/Year | Price | Auto-Enforced |
|------|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Essentials | 5 | $49 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Stress Free | 12 | $99 | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Concierge | 25 | $199 | ‚úÖ Yes |

The cron job will skip creating orders if a user reaches their limit.

## üöÄ Ready to Go!

Everything is implemented and ready. Just:

1. ‚úÖ Run migration
2. ‚úÖ Set CRON_SECRET
3. ‚úÖ Deploy to Vercel
4. ‚úÖ Test the fulfillment dashboard

The system will automatically create orders every night, and you can print labels + cards every morning!

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "No orders showing in fulfillment dashboard"
- Orders are only created 15 days before occasions
- Make sure users have recipients with occasions added
- Check cron job logs

### "Print button not working"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify jsPDF is installed: `npm list jspdf`
- Try printing a single order first

### "Cron job not creating orders"
- Verify CRON_SECRET matches in Vercel
- Check that occasions exist in database
- Look at cron response for skip reasons

### "Card limit errors"
- User has reached their subscription limit
- Check order count: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE user_id=X AND card_type='subscription' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at)=2025`
- Consider upgrading their plan

## üí° Future Enhancements

Some ideas for future features:

1. **Purchase Flows**: Add Stripe checkout for bulk packs and individual cards
2. **Email Notifications**: Alert customers when cards are mailed
3. **Analytics**: Dashboard showing monthly card volumes
4. **Card Designs**: Let customers choose from multiple card templates
5. **Address Validation**: Auto-validate addresses before creating orders
6. **Batch Exports**: Export daily orders to CSV for record keeping
7. **Shipping Labels**: Integration with USPS for tracking numbers
